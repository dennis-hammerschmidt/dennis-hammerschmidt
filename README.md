### Hi and welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Mannheim, working with a multitude of different data science/computational social science tools and methods in various contexts and for different purposes. Some of the projects that I am either working on or have been working on include:

- :microscope: The R package [overivewR](https://github.com/cosimameyer/overviewR) that lets you easily explore your datasets
- :world_map: The [repo](https://github.com/CorrelAid/erlassjahr) for an interactive [ShinyApp](https://erlassjahr.de/informieren/karte-ueberschuldete-staaten-weltweit/) developed for [erlassjahr](https://erlassjahr.de) as part of a [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/en/) project to visualize the worldwide debt situation
- :microbe: The [Coro2vid](https://github.com/dennis-hammerschmidt/Coro2vid-19) ShinyApp that provides a keywords-based searchable interface across 22,000+ abstracts on coronaviruses to let you search those articles that best match your needs and interests
- :bar_chart: My data visualization gallery for [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/dennis-hammerschmidt/tidy_tuesday)

Other projects, especially research projects, will also be made available here once they are accpected or published :nerd_face:
